So, its crucial that we make right choice on deciding the location before we open up the business. We would suggest to open the restaurants near the compititor's as it not only gives us access to their excess customers but also a chance to prove our products quality. So we are going to look into key things to decide on the location. There are \"Locations with one or more restaurants\" , \"Locations with no Indian restaurants in the surroundings\" and \"Locations which are close to city center as possible\"."
